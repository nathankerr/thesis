\chapter{DESIGN}

How fulfill requirements

Dataset centric (no need for record level locking, etc.)

Data parallel for speed/scaleup

Batch mode processing

\section{HadoopGIS}

Uses JTS

Map/Reduce

``Communication'' only possible in Reduce

Multiple Map/Reduce phases

How to use more than one dataset

Limited dataset distribution models

\section{ClusterGIS}

Uses GEOS

Split using MPI-IO

Communicate using MPI, possibility for different distributions

How a basic program works

How to use more than one dataset

Datasets could be distributed in any way imaginable.
