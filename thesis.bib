	Abstract = {With the increasing availability of large quantity of geospatial data, and the growing complexity of spatial algorithms, they are the most compelling challenges to the GIS computing efficiency. Faced the problems of computing and I/O intensive, it's an appropriate approach that involves the techniques such as distributed or parallel computing into GIS context. Some researches concerned into the parallelization algorithms for most all parts of GIS respectively, but few involved in the parallel architecture from integrating the specified overall GIS package into cluster. Fortunately, we discuss multi-users parallelization model (MUPM) for GRASS GIS from making full use of its character of Multi-users, in which many GRASS users, located in different nodes, can work concurrently on subtasks. Under MUPM, the running function module maybe in sequential or parallel, i.e., most modules of GRASS can work in cluster with high performance without the need for redesigning and re-implementing existing algorithms. According to this, the framework, approach and key technologies etc. with cluster-based parallel GIS are introduced. Finally, some tentative results are also available for illustration.},

OSM follows the peer production model that created Wikipedia; its aim is to create a set of map data that's free to use, editable, and licensed under new copyright schemes. A considerable number of contributors edit the world map collaboratively using the OSM technical infrastructure, and a core group, estimated at approximately 40 volunteers, dedicate their time to creating and improving OSM's infrastructure, including maintaining the server, writing the core software that handles the transactions with the server, and creating cartographical outputs. There's also a growing community of software developers who develop software tools to make OSM data available for further use across different application domains, software platforms, and hardware devices. The OSM project's hub is the main OSM Web site.},

@conference{hadoop,
	Abstract = {In this work we present an scientific application that has been given a Hadoop MapReduce implementation. We also discuss other scientific fields of supercomputing that could benefit from a MapReduce implementation. We recognize in this work that Hadoop has potential benefit for more applications than simply data mining, but that it is not a panacea for all data intensive applications. We provide an example of how the halo finding application, when applied to large astrophysics datasets, benefits from the model of the Hadoop architecture. The halo finding application uses a friends of friends algorithm to quickly cluster together large sets of particles to output files which a visualization software can interpret. The current implementation requires that large datasets be moved from storage to computation resources for every simulation of astronomy data. Our Hadoop implementation allows for an in-place halo finding application on the datasets, which removes the time consuming process of transferring data between resources.},

@inproceedings{4736879,
	Abstract = {The growth of data used by data-intensive computations, e.g. geographical information systems (GIS), has far outpaced the growth of the power of a single processor. The increasing demand of data-intensive applications calls for distributed computing. In this paper, we propose a high performance workflow system MRGIS, a parallel and distributed computing platform based on MapReduce clusters, to execute GIS applications efficiently. MRGIS consists of a design interface, a task scheduler, and a runtime support system. The design interface has two options: a GUI-based workflow designer and an API-based library for programming in Python. Given a GIS workflow, the scheduler analyzes data dependencies among tasks, then dispatches them to MapReduce clusters based on the current status of the system. Our experiment demonstrates that MRGIS can significantly improve the performance of GIS workflow execution.},
