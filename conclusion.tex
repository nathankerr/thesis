% FIXME: Conclusion

By simplifying the requirements to handle process GIS operations in
parallel, the cost to implementing parallel solutions will decrease,
enabling more parallel processing methods to be created. This parallel
methods will be able to take advantage of the increased processing powers
made available through compute clusters.

Another benefit of this research is a classification of geospatial
operations based on data access requirements and a sample set of queries
to evaluate the efficiency of a parallel GIS processing implementation.
